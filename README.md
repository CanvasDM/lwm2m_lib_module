Device Management LwM2M Client Component

lib_lwm2m is a temporary fork of the subsys/net/lib/lwm2m from Zephyr
to be used for developing new LwM2M features outside of the Zephyr tree.
This version was forked from commit 8a16614a82ec5d21584cdf4eb82f114f1d38c1a8
of git@git.devops.rfpros.com:zephyr_public/zephyr.git
(laird/ncs-1.9.0-1 branch).
